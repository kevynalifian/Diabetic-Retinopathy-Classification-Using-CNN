# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Using CNN
## Description:
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, occurs due to damage to the retina caused by prolonged diabetes mellitus. DR can be classified through retinal fundus images. However, classifying diabetic retinopathy is time-consuming, and there is currently no model with high performance in classifying DR. The objective of this study is to propose a model that is expected to have a higher accuracy rate than previous studies. The method used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Evaluation results show that classifying DR using a modified CNN architecture achieves an accuracy of 96.45%. In this study, the accuracy of the classification model can be improved by using a modified CNN architecture.
